================

I forgot to respond to the JTleek review.

Helpful article, especially since, for the first time in my life, I'm dealing with reviewers right now and helping review some papers.

I don't agree with this point: "Reject if the paper is clearly not an improvement on the current state of the art." I think it depends on the impact factor of the journal obviously, but I think replicability in science is something we are missing. This isn't a bold point on my part. If you reject a paper because it isn't cutting edge we cease to see how consistent results across settings etc.

I wish more reviewers would structure their feedback in the way the author suggest, breaking up minor and major issues. I feel like you get this sometimes, but more structure always makes feedback easier.
